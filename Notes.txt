Notes for OneLua developers:
- It seems that 3D Models need to have (proper) materials.
- Images must be 8-Bit, not 16-Bit (convert original.png -colors 235 -o fixed.png).
- Eboots can edited with PSP Brew.
- "ATRACTool-Reloaded" might come with the needed AT3 conversion utilities.


Thanks to the Onelua Team.
Big ups to the testers who provided battery data for me to chart.
