Notes for OneLua developers:
- It seems that 3D Models need to have (proper) materials
- Images must be 8-Bit, not 16-Bit (convert original.png -colors 235 -o fixed.png)
- Eboots can edited with PSP Brew


Thanks to the Onelua Team.
Shoutouts to Quadruple for being a rubber duck debugger.
Special thanks to my partner for their support <3
