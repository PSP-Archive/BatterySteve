Notes for OneLua developers:
- It seems that 3D Models need to have (proper) materials.
- Images must be 8-Bit, not 16-Bit (convert original.png -colors 235 -o fixed.png).
- Eboots can edited with PSP Brew.
- "ATRACTool-Reloaded" might come with the needed AT3 conversion utilities.


Thanks to the Onelua Team.
Big ups to the testers who provided battery data for me to chart, you too - if you do it!

Special thanks to Pinja for their support <3


The different PSP motherboards have different brightness values!
There is no proper documentation and getting them from idstorage has proved to be a bit problematic...

Devkits/Testkits:
OneLua does not have a way to properly inform of those so... uhh - fucked on that front
(yes the mobos are known but, this is just OL being shit).

WIP:
Release source code is minifed because that achieves a whopping 45.62% compression ratio (on average).
For unminified source code, look at:
