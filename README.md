## Features

- **Real Load Simulation**: Renders a 2D+3D scene to simulate a "real" load on the system.
- **Compatibility**: Works with all PSP models, including 1000, 2000, 3000, Go, and Street.
- **Battery Compatibility**: Compatible with both official Sony batteries and third-party batteries.
- **Runtime Tracking**: Runs until the battery is depleted and displays the runtime. It also saves the last run's data to `score.old.txt`.

## System Requirements

- **Custom Firmware**: A PSP with custom firmware is required.
- **Memory Space**: At least 9MB of free space on the Memory Stick.
- **Special Instructions for Street/GO Users**: You might need to start the test by pressing Select when the battery is full, as these devices lack proper battery management.

## Installation

1. **Download**: Download the BatterySteve ZIP file.
2. **Extract**: Extract the contents to your PSP's `/PSP/GAME/` folder.
3. **Run**: Launch BatterySteve from the XMB menu under the Game section.
