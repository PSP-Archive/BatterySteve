# BatterySteve - PSP Battery Tester

BatterySteve is a lightweight and easy-to-use tool designed to test the real capacity of your PSP battery. It eliminates the guesswork involved in determining how much power is left in your battery.

## Features

- **Real Load Simulation**: Renders a 2D+3D scene to simulate a "real" load on the system.
- **Compatibility**: Works with all PSP models, including 1000, 2000, 3000, Go, and Street.
- **Battery Compatibility**: Compatible with both official Sony batteries and third-party batteries.
- **Runtime Tracking**: Runs until the battery is depleted and displays the runtime. It also saves the last run's data to `score.old.txt`.

## Requirements

- **CFW**: A PSP with custom firmware is required (Preferably [ARK-4](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/ARK-4))
- **Space**: At least 11MB of free space on the Memory Stick.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Street/GO Users**: You might need to start the test by pressing Select when the battery is full, as these devices lack proper battery management. ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Installation

1. **Download**: Download the BatterySteve ZIP file.
2. **Extract**: Extract the contents to your PSP's `/PSP/GAME/` folder.
